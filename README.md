```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "salesforce": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--from",
                "salesforce-mcp",
                "salesforce"
            ],
            "env": {
                "USERNAME": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_USERNAME",
                "PASSWORD": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_PASSWORD",
